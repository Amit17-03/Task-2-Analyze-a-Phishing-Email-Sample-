If we do not receive your verification within 12 hours, your account will be permanently deactivated.

3. Suspicious Links
Link text: Reactivate Account

Hover URL: http://m1crosoft-verify.com/login

Words like:

“Final Warning”

“account termination”

“within 12 hours”

5. Spelling or Grammar Issues
Slightly awkward phrasing:

“we are initiating a security lock”

“receive your verification” (missing “response” or “confirmation”)

Minor Indicator: Not outright wrong, but slightly unnatural wording suggests it may not be from a professional sender.
